### How Alysum Runs

Alysum is distributed as a **compiled Windows executable**.

- Users **ONLY run **`Alysum.exe`
- **Node.js is NOT required**
- **npm is NOT required**
- No terminal usage
- No source code setup

If Alysum needs Node internally, it is **already bundled** and **handled automatically**.

Users should **never install Node.js** unless explicitly told otherwise.

---

### Installation (What users actually do)

1. Extract the files
2. Edit `config.js`
3. (Optional) Create `keys.txt`
4. Double-click `Alysum.exe`

That’s it.

If you want, I can:

- rewrite the **entire docs** in this exact tone
- add a **FAQ** like “Do I need Node? (No)”
- clean up the **Quickstart** so nobody gets confused again
